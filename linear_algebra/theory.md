# **Linear Algebra in Machine Learning**

Linear algebra is a foundational area of mathematics that provides the tools to represent and manipulate data, perform transformations, and analyze relationships between variables. This folder explores key concepts in linear algebra with practical implementations in machine learning and data science.



## **1. Matrix Operations**
### **Concept**
Matrices are used to represent datasets, linear transformations, and equations. Common operations include:
- **Addition and Multiplication**:
  - Addition: Element-wise sum.
  - Multiplication: Combines linear transformations.
- **Transpose**:
  - Flips rows and columns of a matrix.
- **Inverse**:
  - Solves systems of equations by reversing transformations.

### **Applications in ML**
- Representing data as features and samples.
- Propagating data through machine learning models.

### **Notebook: `matrix_operations.ipynb`**
- Implement and explore addition, multiplication, and inverses.
- Visualize transformations applied to data.



## **2. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**
### **Concept**
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors provide insights into matrix properties and transformations:
- **Eigenvector**: A vector that remains in the same direction after a transformation.
- **Eigenvalue**: The scaling factor of the eigenvector.

$$
Av = \lambda v
$$

Where:
- $A$: Matrix.
- $v$: Eigenvector.
- $\lambda$: Eigenvalue.

### **Applications in ML**
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
- Stability analysis in optimization problems.

### **Notebook: `eigenvalues_eigenvectors.ipynb`**
- Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors for covariance matrices.
- Visualize eigenvectors as directions of maximum variance.



## **3. Matrix Factorization**
### **Concept**
Matrix factorization decomposes a matrix into simpler matrices for easier computation and analysis:
- **LU Decomposition**: Factorizes a matrix into a product of lower and upper triangular matrices.
- **QR Decomposition**: Factorizes a matrix into orthogonal and upper triangular matrices.

### **Applications in ML**
- Solving linear systems.
- Optimizing computations in large-scale problems.

### **Notebook: `matrix_factorization.ipynb`**
- Explore LU and QR decompositions.
- Apply matrix factorization to solve real-world problems.



## **4. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and PCA**
### **Concept**
SVD decomposes a matrix into three components:

$$
A = U \Sigma V^T
$$

- $U$: Left singular vectors.
- $\Sigma$: Singular values.
- $V^T$: Right singular vectors.

PCA uses eigenvectors of the covariance matrix to project data onto axes of maximum variance.

### **Applications in ML**
- Dimensionality reduction.
- Noise reduction in datasets.

### **Notebook: `svd_pca.ipynb`**
- Perform SVD to analyze data.
- Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization.



## **5. Linear Transformations**
### **Concept**
Linear transformations map data points to new positions in space:

$$
T(x) = Ax
$$

- Common transformations: Scaling, rotation, reflection, projection.

### **Applications in ML**
- Normalizing features for consistent scaling.
- Rotating data for PCA or clustering.

### **Notebook: `linear_transformations.ipynb`**
- Visualize transformations such as scaling and rotation.
- Apply transformations to modify datasets.



## **6. Tensor Operations**
### **Concept**
Tensors generalize matrices to higher dimensions, representing multi-dimensional data.
- **Rank**: Dimensionality of the tensor.
- Operations include reshaping, slicing, and broadcasting.

### **Applications in ML**
- Representing multi-dimensional data (e.g., images, time series).
- Tensor manipulations in deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

### **Notebook: `tensor_operations.ipynb`**
- Explore tensor operations such as reshaping and slicing.
- Apply tensors to represent image data.



## **7. Matrix Norms and Distances**
### **Concept**
Matrix norms measure the magnitude of matrices, while distances quantify similarity between data points:
- **Norms**:
  - $L_1$: Sum of absolute values.
  - $L_2$: Euclidean distance.
  - Frobenius: Generalized L2 norm for matrices.
- **Distances**:
  - Euclidean, Manhattan, Cosine similarity.

### **Applications in ML**
- Regularization in regression models (Lasso, Ridge).
- Clustering and classification algorithms.

### **Notebook: `matrix_norms_distances.ipynb`**
- Compute matrix norms and distances.
- Use distance metrics in k-NN or clustering.



## **8. Practical Applications**
### **Cross-Cutting Use Cases**:
1. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - SVD and PCA for reducing dataset complexity.
2. **Data Transformations**:
   - Scaling and rotation for preprocessing and visualization.
3. **Tensor Manipulation**:
   - Reshaping and broadcasting for multi-dimensional datasets.
